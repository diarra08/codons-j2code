					<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
					<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and
					 typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
					dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
					of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived 
					not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
					remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
					the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
					 recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
					including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
					</div><p><br></p><div>
					<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
					<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
					 readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of 
					using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of 
					letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it 
					look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web 
					page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a 
					search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their 
					infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by 
					accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
					</div><p><br><br></p><div>
					<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
					<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
					 has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
					it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
					Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
					Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
					the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the 
					undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 
					of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by 
					Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of 
					ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem 
					Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 
					1.10.32.</p><p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
					 reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 
					from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in 
					their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
					 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
